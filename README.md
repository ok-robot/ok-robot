OK-Robot is a zero-shot modular framework that effectively combines the state-of-art navigation and manipulation models to perform pick and place tasks in real homes. It has been tested in 10 real homes on 170+ objects and achieved a total success rate of 58.5%.

## Hardware and software requirements
Hardware required:
* An iPhone Pro with Lidar sensors
* [Hello Robot Stretch](https://hello-robot.com/) with Dex Wrist installed
* A workstation with GPU to run pretrained models 

Software required:
* Python 3.9
* Record3D (>1.18.0)
* [CloudCompare](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/release/)

## Installation
* You need to get anygrasp [license and checkpoint](./ok-robot-manipulation/anygrasp_license_registration/README.md).
* [Install](./docs/workspace-installation.md) the necessary environment on workstation to run the navigation and manipulation modules
* [Verify the workspace installation](./docs/installation-verification.md) once the above steps are completed.
* [Install](./docs/robot-installation.md) the necessary packages on robot to be able to properly communicate with backend workstation.
* You might also need to get a [new calibrated URDF](./docs/robot-calibration.md) for accurate robot manipulation.

Once both the robot and workstation are complete. You are good to start the experiments.

## Run Experiments

First [set up the environment](./docs/environment-setup.md) with the tapes, position the robot properly and scan the environment to get a r3d file from Record3D. Place it in `/navigation/r3d/` run following commands.


### On Workstation:

In one terminal run the [Navigation Module](./ok-robot-navigation/).
```
mamba activate ok-robot-env

cd ok-robot-navigation
python path_planning.py debug=False min_height={z coordinates of the ground tapes + 0.1} dataset_path='r3d/{your_r3d_filename}.r3d' cache_path='{your_r3d_filename}.pt' pointcloud_path='{your_r3d_filename}.ply'
```

In another terminal run the [Manipulation module](./ok-robot-manipulation/README.md)
```
mamba activate ok-robot-env

cd ok-robot-manipulation/src
python demo.py --open_communication --debug
```

### On Robot:

Before running anything on the robot, you need to calibrate it by 
```
stretch_robot_home.py
```

Our robot codes rely on robot controllers provided by [home-robot](https://github.com/facebookresearch/home-robot). Just like running other home-robot based codes, you need to run two processes synchronously in two terminals.

In one terminal start the home-robot
```
roslaunch home_robot_hw startup_stretch_hector_slam.launch
```

In another terminal run the robot control. More details in [ok-robot-hw](./ok-robot-hw/README.md)
```
cd ok-robot-hw

python run.py -x1 [x1] -y1 [y1] -x2 [x2] -y2 [y2] -ip [your workstation ip]
```

## Roadmap

While OK-Robot can do quite a bit by itself, we think there are plenty of room for improvement for a zero-shot, home-dwelling robot. That's why we consider OK-Robot a living release, and will try to occasionally add new features to this. We also encourage you to take a look at the list below, and if you are interested, share your improvements with the community by contributing to this project.

- [x] Create OK-Robot, a shared platform for a zero-shot, open-vocab pick-and-place robot.
- [x] Integrate grasping primitive with AnyGrasp.
- [x] Integrate open-vocabulary navigation with VoxelMap.
- [x] Integrate heuristic based dropping.
- [ ] Improve documentation.
- [ ] Add error detection/recovery from failure while manipulating.
- [ ] Figure out interactive navigation: if an object is not found or a query is ambiguous, ask the end-user.
- [ ] Integrate with an open-source grasp perception model so that we can MIT-license all the dependencies.
